      fun fact: did you know that the day before a holiday's "eve" is considered an "adam"?<br>a fun fact indeed.
      <br><br>
      another fun fact (really a guess teehee :3)
      <br><br>
      you are likely paranoid. most of the things you are scared of only exist based off of interpretations paranoia hand-crafted for you; but this craft ain't a cute DIY project you found on [website]. paranoia wants you to be scared. paranoia wants to paralyze you. paranoia preys on the exact fears it knows you have, and uses it against you.
      <br><br>speaking a bit personally, paranoia wants me to believe that 2025 will be another fruitless year, or worse. that because of a particular individual, that everything is doomed. but i don't know that. i only know that i've been in my room for the past 5 years on end, leaving only for food, family trips, or "taxes". i don't know a lot, and so i've hidden from a lot.
      <br><br>me personally, i don't know what i'm going to do in 2025, or if i'll even be alive for most, half, or even some of it. but hozier damn it all if i insist on hearing out the hyper-paranoia, and believeing in it. i do care about my safety, and i know that being in a self-afflicted terminal situation is not fun anymore. i liked having no school, but doing nothing as a tradeoff sucks fart bubbles. 
      <br><br>for 2025? i'm don't know what's gonna happen, but i'm gonna stop blindly following paranoia into a pit of monochrome omen.
      <br><br>happy new years, eve.
