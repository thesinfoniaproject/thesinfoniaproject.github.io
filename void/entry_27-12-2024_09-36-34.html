    <h3 style="color:white;">since i don't want everything to host my stress dump stuff (FOR THE TIME BEING), i'm porting all of my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thesinfoniaproject.bsky.social" style="color:#5050b0;">bluesky</a> posts that were stress dumps into the void.</h3><br><br>

    "that random moment throughout the day where you realize that the things that are supposed to be an escape from reality has become your "new" reality, and how the real world and your "new" reality both suck yet you can't escape one without going into the other"

    "random little thing that came up in an audio journal i made today:

i'm happy to have a little safety bubble my trauma made to "protect me from the world that hurt me", but i hate that i have allowed that bubble to keep me from doing anything with my life. i'm alive, but i've been too scared to live. too scared of disapproval, not fitting in, failing-<br><br>
fuck allat. sincerely, fuck it all. i simply wanna fuck around and find out the one chance i get to. i wanna be able to learn from failure rather than be worried that failure is the fate of everything i do. i wanna grow out of what's comfortable rather than conform to it to the point of misery.<br><br>i wanna create things for the hell of it, not with the intent of making MILLIONS. i wanna do things even if i don't know how to do it; and to that point: i wanna take the time to learn how to do things even if it takes time away from completing the main thing.<br><br>i'm tired of relying on an undefined fear of topics X Y and Z to determine if i can go through with anything. i just want to do things. fuck whatever nonsense my brain uses as justification for stagnancy; i wanna risk failure if it means i have UNDENIABLE proof of my abilities."
